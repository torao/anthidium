# Data File Format

## Basic

* All signed/unsigned multi-byte integer `INT16`, `INT32` and `INT64` are stored in Little Endian.
* Application data indicated by `JSON` type is actually saved in MessagePack format.

## Common Structure

### Data Types

The data types described in this format specification are as follows:

| Notation  |     Size[B] | Name                     | Values |
|:----------|------------:|:-------------------------|:-------|
| `BIT`     |         1/8 | 1 bit (packed in a byte) | `0` or `1` |
| `INT`     |  1,2,4,8,16 | signed integer           | 
| `UINT`    |  1,2,4,8,16 | unsigned integer         |
| `VARINT`  | 1-3,1-5,1-9 | variant-encoded signed integer |
| `VARUINT` | 1-3,1-5,1-9 | variant-encoded unsigned integer |
| `FLOAT`   | 2,4,8,10,16 | floating point           |
| `JSON`    |           * | json representation      |

The `JSON` type is a complex type of `VARUINT32` length and JSON binary encoded with MessagePack.

| Notation    | Size[B] | Name                        |
|:------------|--------:|:----------------------------|
| `VARUINT32` |     1-5 | length                      |
| `UINT8[*]`  |       * | msgpack-encoded json binary |

The data type used for vector space can be selected from `BIT`, `INT*`, `UINT*`, `FLOAT*`.
We use the type `VTYPE` as vector space and call it space resolution.

### Variant Integer Type

This specification introduce variable length integers `VARINT`. The purpose to introduce `VARINT` in this protocol isn't to store precision-indeterminate numerical values but to save values with deviation efficiently. The encoding of `VARINT` is the same as the Protocol Buffers specification.

In this specification, `VARINT` and `VARUINT` are introduced for the purpose to reduce its data-size. This is same encoding as the specification of [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#varints).

The variant-encoded integers are multi-byte but the restored size MUST NOT exceed the specification length. For example, the value restored from `VARUTINT16` field must be in the range from 0 to 65,535.

The `VARINT` value is treated the same as `VARUINT` after performing the following ZigZag encoding.

```
if(value < 0) abs(value) * 2 - 1 else value * 2
```

## File Header

The first 4 bytes of data file must begin 2-byte file-signature followed by file-format-version.

| Type       | Description                   | Example  |
|:-----------|:------------------------------|:---------|
| `UINT8[2]` | File Signature (Magic Number) | `'VS'`   |
| `UINT16`   | File Format Version           | `0x0000` |

All implementations MUST acquire exclusive lock on this 4-bytes when it writes data in, and shared lock when read.

### Block Structure

| Field Size | Description | Data Type | Comments |
|:-----------|:------------|:----------|:---------|
| 1          | type        | `UINT8`   | Block signature |
| 4          | length      | `UINT32`  | Length of payload in number of bytes |
| *          | payload     | `UINT8[]` | The actual block data depends on signature |

This data format commonly uses TLV (Type-Length-Value) structure for all data-block. Therefore, your application can safely skip any block that be not able to recognize block-signature, or padding additional data field.

The block-signature is 1-byte code. Typically US-ASCII code that identify block characteristic. The length field doesn't contain the signature and length field size.

## File Header

The data-file must begin 2-byte file-signature followed by file-format-version.

| Type       | Description                   | Example  |
|:-----------|:------------------------------|:---------|
| `UINT8[2]` | File Signature (Magic Number) | `'VS'`   |
| `UINT16`   | File Format Version           | `0x0000` |

All implementations MUST acquire exclusive lock on this 4-bytes when it writes data in.

## Vector Space Meta-Information Block

| Field Size | Description | Data Type      | Comments                        |
|:-----------|:------------|:---------------|:--------------------------------|

A static type is assigned as resolution of the individual vector space. The type identifier is embedded in the header block, and the following values are assigned to each type.
Type code is present as following `INT8` values:

| TYPE       | Code | Size of Element |
|:-----------|:-----|:-----|
| `BOOL`     | `0`  | 1/8  |
| `UINT8`    | `1`  | 1    |
| `INT8`     | `-1` | 1    |
| `UINT16`   | `2`  | 2    |
| `INT16`    | `-2` | 2    |
| `UINT32`   | `3`  | 4    |
